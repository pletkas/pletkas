### Welcome to my personal project account
This page is a collection of projects I have/am working on as I learn more about programming/stats/data analysis. 
My goals with this page is to host projects I have and showcase some of the efforts I have put into learning data focused programming and to hopefully update some projects 
as I get more data or improve in my analysis skills. My current goals are to learn more statistics in university classes I am taking, and to become more proficient at all things
R programming and maybe learn some more advanced SQL through completing projects.
